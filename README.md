# PerlWatcher

![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/basiliscos/perl-watcher.png "Build status")

## Description

Nagios-inspired system tray events desktop watcher / notifier. The main
difference, that it is desktop application.

There is too many programs (system update, news, weather etc), which notify
you about it via it's own style.

Do you need to track and aggregate events from the different sources?
PerlWatcher can do simplified infrastructure monitoring (pinging them),
track stock quotes, weather, new software updates, poll the remote VCS
for RSS updates, be notified by local news or by some changes on your
/var/log/messages? Do you want to have possibility to easily write your own
event-watcher in the case you local media-content provider does not have any
API no notify you about new films and you fill yourself hackish enough to do
some reverse engineering for writing your watcher?

If yes, than PerlWatcher is designed for that purpose.

PerlWatcher supports also an different levels of notification: "notice",
"info" .. "alert". They indicate how important the event is for you: if you are
doing an boring task it's natural to switch attention to anything else for
couple of seconds; but if the task is serious it can rise the notification
level to 'alert' to be disturbed only by blackout on remote servers :)

It looks like (Gtk2 UI):

## PerlWatcher and RSS-Aggregator

PerlWatcher isn't designed to be fully functional RSS-Aggregator, because:
* RSS-feeds news often aren't complete as web version, because web-masters
need you to go to the site and see the banners. It isn't very pleasant to
read only the half part of the news, and then go to the site to see the
full version.
* PerlWatcher is designed to be lightweight: displaying simple text (headers)
is enough for that, while showing the HTML with images isn't so.

## Installation
```
git clone
dzil build
cpanm ./App-PerlWatcher-UI-Gtk2-0.04
```

### Running
```
perl-watcher-gtk
```

Edit ~/.perl-watcher/engine.conf and add/modify watchers like:

```
        {
            class => 'App::PerlWatcher::Watcher::Ping',
            config => {
                host    =>  'google.com',
                port    =>  80,
                frequency   =>  10,
                on => { fail => { 5 => 'alert' } },
            },
        },

        {
            class => 'App::PerlWatcher::Watcher::Rss',
            config => {
                url         =>  'http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/opennews_all.rss',
                title       =>  'opennet',
                frequency   => 60,
                timeout     => 10,
                items       =>  5,
                on          => {
                        ok      => { 1  => 'notice' },
                        fail    => { 10 => 'info/max' },
                },
            },
        },

```

## Development

Any help, critique, suggestions, requests, advises... are welcome. Especially,
I have troubles with Gtk2 UI.

Current road map can be found here https://github.com/basiliscos/perl-watcher/blob/master/TODO

## Design

PerlWatcher is written in Modern Perl using AnyEvent and Moo.

PerlWatcher is composed of Engine (including basic watchers) and UI. Currently
it uses only GTK2+ back-end, but it should be easy to use the others, like:
KDE, console or even aggregate it as tmux-extension.
