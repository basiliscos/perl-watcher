CORE:
# watcher groups?
# watcher actions: reset, mute, act (click), force check?
# timestamps should include dates for sub-events?

REFACTOR:
# watcher/watcher_function/guard
# Gtk2: decompose application into smaller number of widgets 

WATCHERS:
# ping: async dns query
# rss: handle errors: non-200
# rss: record timestamp
# rss: non-notification states (including warnings)
# rss: smart update: use header's info 'if-modified-since'
# weather watcher
# json watcher
# http watcher
# reminder watcher

GUI:
# hints on summary page on every status
# collapse watchers (rss/filemanager) if there is no events.
# notification level per watcher and default ?
# colorize output
# icons by status
# sorting: by priority, by config

BUGS:
# failing test for file tail watcher
# handle errors in rss thread (silently ignore)
