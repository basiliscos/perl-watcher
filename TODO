CORE:
# watcher groups?
# watcher actions: reset, mute, act (click), force check?
# timestamps should include dates for sub-events?
# engine: watcher save state between invocations?
# update status (tray icon) to notify changes, filtered by some level?
# about/version information?
# research the possible usage of Module::Pluggable

REFACTOR:
# watcher/watcher_function/guard
# engine: move out guess frontend into bootstrap? 

WATCHERS:
# ping: async dns query
# ping: udp proto
# ping: icmp proto: external program fork
# rss: handle errors: non-200
# rss: record timestamp
# rss: smart update: use header's info 'if-modified-since'
# rss: gather item titles or bodies
# rss: display bodies as hints?
# filetail: add beautifyer?
# weather watcher
# json watcher
# reminder watcher

GUI:
# mark as uninteresting action for all statuses?
# collapse watchers (rss/filemanager) if there is no events.
# notification level per watcher and default ?
# colorize output
# icons by status
# sorting: by priority, by config

BUGS:
# handle errors in rss thread (silently ignore?)
