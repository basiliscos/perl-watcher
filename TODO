CORE:
# watcher groups?
# watcher actions: reset, mute, act (click), force check?
# timestamps should include dates for sub-events?
# engine: watcher save state between invocations?
# update status (tray icon) to notify changes, filtered by some level?
# about/version information?

REFACTOR:
# watcher/watcher_function/guard
# engine: move out guess frontend into bootstrap? 
# engine: move out stash logic into separate class 

WATCHERS:
# ping: async dns query
# ping: udp proto
# ping: icmp proto: external program fork
# rss: handle errors: non-200
# rss: record timestamp
# rss: non-notification states (including warnings)
# rss: smart update: use header's info 'if-modified-since'
# rss: gather headers or bodies
# weather watcher
# json watcher
# http watcher
# reminder watcher

GUI:
# hints on summary page on every status
# collapse watchers (rss/filemanager) if there is no events.
# notification level per watcher and default ?
# colorize output
# icons by status
# sorting: by priority, by config

BUGS:
# handle errors in rss thread (silently ignore?)
