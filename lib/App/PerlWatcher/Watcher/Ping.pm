=head1 NAME

App::PerlWatcher::Watcher::Ping - Watches for host availablity via pingig it (ICMP) or knoking to it's port (TCP)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.16_4

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # use the following config for Engine:

        {
            class => 'App::PerlWatcher::Watcher::Ping',
            config => {
                host    =>  'google.com',
                frequency   =>  10,
                on => { fail => { 5 => 'alert' } },
            },
        },
 # if the port was defined it does TCP-knock to that port.
 # TCP-knock is required for some hosts, that don't answer to
 # ICMP echo requests, e.g. notorious microsoft.com :)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
